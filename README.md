ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KGed, or Keegan

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Iowa! My main stack includes C# for back-end and mostly native JS front-end. I also work with a legacy codebase at my workplace.

I enjoy fiddling around and learning new tricks of the trade to improve my craft for work.

My current plans are to start relearning a lot of the front-end frameworks and developing side-projects when I can.
